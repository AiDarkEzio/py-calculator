- Introducing our feature-rich calculator application designed to make your mathematical calculations a breeze. With an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), beautiful color schemes, a history section, and round borders, this calculator offers a delightful user experience while maintaining functionality.

The calculator's GUI is built using Tkinter, a popular Python library for creating graphical interfaces. Upon launching the application, a sleek window appears, showcasing the calculator's elegant design. The background color, set to a soothing shade of #f2f2f2, creates a visually appealing environment that complements the overall user interface.

At the heart of the calculator lies a responsive entry field. This input/output section, with its white background (#ffffff) and black text color (#000000), provides a clear and legible display for your calculations. The font, Arial, ensures optimal readability, even for extended mathematical expressions.

Directly below the entry field, we've incorporated a handy history section. As you perform calculations and press the "=" button, your expressions and their corresponding results are automatically logged in the history. This feature allows you to track your calculations, review previous results, and even double-check your work. The history section shares the same aesthetic qualities as the entry field, maintaining consistency throughout the application.

The calculator's keypad consists of well-designed buttons for numeric input and mathematical operations. Each button has a pleasing background color (#d9d9d9) and legible black text color (#000000). By clicking these buttons, you can effortlessly enter numbers and operators into the entry field. The buttons' round borders, achieved through a border width of 0 and a relief style set to "RAISED," contribute to a modern and visually pleasing appearance.

The numeric buttons from 0 to 9 are conveniently arranged in a grid pattern, mirroring the layout of traditional calculators. This familiar structure ensures ease of use, particularly for users accustomed to physical calculators. The arithmetic operator buttons, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), are placed adjacent to the numeric buttons, following an intuitive logic that enables swift mathematical operations.

To enhance user experience, we've added a dedicated clear button (C), located at the bottom left of the keypad. With a single click, you can effortlessly erase the contents of the entry field, allowing you to start fresh or correct any mistakes. This user-friendly feature saves time and streamlines your calculations.

Finally, the equal button (=) signifies the execution of your calculation. Upon pressing this button, the calculator evaluates the expression in the entry field. If the expression is valid and can be computed, the result is promptly displayed in the entry field. In case of any errors, such as division by zero or invalid syntax, an "Error" message appears, alerting you to potential issues in the expression.

Our calculator application brings together functionality and aesthetics, offering a sophisticated and visually pleasing tool for your mathematical needs. Whether you're a student, professional, or anyone in need of quick and accurate calculations, this calculator is designed to simplify your work and enhance your productivity.
